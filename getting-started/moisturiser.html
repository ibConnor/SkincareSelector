<h3 class="sub-title">Moisturiser</h3>
<p class="info">When it comes to skincare, products that help to lock in moisture are essential. Moistureisers help to keep the skin hydrated, preventing dryness and irritation. They can also help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. For men, using a moistureiser is an important part of a daily skincare routine. Not only does it help to keep the skin looking young and healthy, but it also feels great</p>
<p class="info">There's nothing like using a product that makes your skin feel smooth and hydrated. If you're not sure how to choose a moistureiser, there are plenty of resources available online. You can read reviews, learn about products, and find the one that's right for you. So don't wait any longer, get out there and find the perfect moistureiser for your needs. Your skin will thank you for it!</p>
<p class="info">You can choose a moisturiser with an SPF (sun protection factor) if applying the  moisturiser in the morning. Look for products labelled broad spectrum, which means they protect against UVA and UVB rays. If you have a moisturiser with SPF then you can use that instead of using a sunscreen but remember to reapply the moisturiser regularly, use a generious amount (2 finger lengths is a good approximation for your face).</p>
<p class="info">Sunscreens often have moisturising ingredients in them so if you are in a hurry in the morning then you can apply a sunscreen in the morning as a moisturiser instead of apply a moisturiser and a sunscreen.</p>

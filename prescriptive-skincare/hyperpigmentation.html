<h3 class="sub-title">Hyperpigmentation</h3>
<p class="info">By targeting the root cause of the issue, you can get the clear and even complexion you've always wanted. Prescription strength ingredients like hydroquinone, kojic acid, and azelaic acid can help to lighten dark spots and discolouration.</p>
<p class="info">In addition to using prescription strength ingredients, it's important to use sunscreen every day. A good sunscreen will help to protect your skin from harmful UV rays that can make hyperpigmentation worse. Look for a sunscreen that has an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>

<h3 class="sub-title">Oil-based cleanser</h3>
    
        <p class="info">Oil-based cleansers are primarily used as the first step in a double cleanse skincare routine. You would normally want to do this at the end off your day to get rid of any make-up and sunscreen that might be left on your skin, the oil-based cleanser helps break up the make-up and sunscreen before you use your water-based cleanser.</p>
        <p class="info">Oil-based cleansers are also known as makeup removers and they are great for getting rid of waterproof mascara and eyeliner. They're also good for removing excess sebum from oily or combination skin types as well as inflammatory acne, since they have anti-inflammatory properties that help calm down redness and irritation on blemishes.</p>

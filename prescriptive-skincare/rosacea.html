<h3 class="sub-title">Rosacea</h3>
<p class="info">Prescriptive skincare for rosacea can be a great way to manage the condition. There are a range of creams and gels that can be prescribed, which can help to keep rosacea under control. It's important to follow the instructions carefully, and to continue using the prescribed skincare even after the symptoms have gone.</p>
<p class="info">It's also important to take antibiotics for 6 to 16 weeks, depending on the severity of the rosacea. IPL (intense pulsed light) treatment may also be available on the NHS - speak to your doctor if you're interested in this option.</p>

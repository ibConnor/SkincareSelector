<h3 class="sub-title">Essence</h3>
<p class="info">Essence is a skincare product that can be applied after your toner and before your serum or moisturizer. It is a lightweight, watery solution that helps to hydrate and nourish the skin.</p>
<p class="info">Essence can help to improve the appearance of the skin by making it look more youthful, plump and bright. Some essences are even designed to target specific concerns such as dryness, dullness or uneven skin tone.</p>
<p class="info">Essences can be found in many different forms including sprays, liquid serums and milks as well as traditional bottles. They're typically used after cleansing or exfoliating but before applying other products like serums or moisturizers.</p>
<p class="info">Some people prefer using an essence instead of an essence-type product because they have sensitive skin which does not tolerate many ingredients in other products. Many essences contain natural ingredients like botanical extracts which are soothing for sensitive skin types.</p>

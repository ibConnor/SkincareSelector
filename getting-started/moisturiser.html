<h3 class="sub-title">Moisturiser</h3>
<p class="info">Moisturisers are one of the most important parts of your skincare routine, and for good reason. Theyâ€™re designed to lock in moisture, which is essential for keeping your skin looking healthy and young.</p>
<p class="info">Moisturisers come in two types: cream or gel. Creams tend to be richer and heavier than gels, but also more hydrating. Gels are lighter and often contain ingredients that help plump up skin cells temporarily.</p>
<p class="info">Moisturising products can be used on all areas of the face (including the eyes). Use small dabs and with care if you use moisturiser around the eye area.</p>
<p class="info">You can choose a moisturiser with an SPF (sun protection factor) if applying the  moisturiser in the morning. Look for products labelled broad spectrum, which means they protect against UVA and UVB rays. If you have a moisturiser with SPF then you can use that instead of using a sunscreen but remember to reapply the moisturiser regularly, use a generious amount (2 finger lengths is a good approximation for your face).</p>
<p class="info">Sunscreens often have moisturising ingredients in them so if you are in a hurry in the morning then you can apply a sunscreen in the morning as a moisturiser instead of apply a moisturiser and a sunscreen.</p>

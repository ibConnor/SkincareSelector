<h3 class="sub-title">Sheet masks</h3>
<p class="info">Sheet masks are a great way to get some extra hydration into your skin. They can be used as often as once a week, but it's important to know that they're not going to give you long-term results. After using a sheet mask, it's important to continue with your skincare routine, which includes moisturizing and sunscreen. Sheet masks are also a great way to try out new products because they come in single-use packets!</p>
<p class="info">Sheet masks come in different varieties. Some contain clay or mud, which can help draw out impurities from the skin. Others contain fruit and vegetable extracts, which provide antioxidants and vitamins for your skin. Some even contain oil-based ingredients like coconut oil or olive oil that help seal in moisture after application.</p>
<p class="info">Sheet masks are usually made from cotton or silk fibers that help deliver ingredients into the skin without irritating it too much or causing breakouts (which is why they should never be left on for too long).</p>

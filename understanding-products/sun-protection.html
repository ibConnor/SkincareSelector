<h3 class="sub-title">Sun protection</h3>
<p class="info">Sun protection is the use of measures such as sunscreen, sun protective clothing and sun avoidance to prevent sunburn, tanning and skin cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that "sun protection behaviors" can be considered part of a lifestyle that promotes health and reduces health risks.</p>
<p class="info">Sunscreen use has been shown to be the most effective way to protect against burns, tanning, aging and skin cancer. In addition to reducing the risk of developing skin cancer by 50% when used correctly, sunscreen prevents squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma.</p>
<p class="info">It is recommended that everyone apply a broad-spectrum UVA/UVB SPF 30+ sunscreen on their skin before venturing outside for extended periods of time, especially during peak sunlight hours from 10 am to 2 pm. Sunscreen should be applied 20 minutes before going outside and should be reapplied every two hours or after swimming or sweating profusely. Sunscreen does not protect against all types of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), but rather blocks only UVB rays.</p>

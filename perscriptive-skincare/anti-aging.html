<h3 class="sub-title">Anti-aging</h3>
<p class="info">As we age, our skin naturally starts to produce less collagen. This can lead to wrinkles, fine lines, and other signs of ageing. Fortunately, there are a number of treatments and procedures available to help build collagen and reduce the appearance of these signs.</p>
<p class="info">No matter what approach you choose, it's important to use sunscreen every day. Not only does sunscreen help protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays, but it can also help keep collagen healthy. Look for a sunscreen that has a SPF of 30 or higher and offers broad-spectrum protection against both UVA and UVB rays. </p>
<p class="info">One of the most effective anti-ageing treatments is retinoid therapy. Retinoids are a class of drugs that include Retinol, which is a form of vitamin A. They help to protect collagen from damage, which can reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. Additionally, retinoids can help to increase cell turnover, which can improve the complexion and give a more youthful appearance.</p>
<p class="info">Another effective treatment for reducing the signs of ageing is laser resurfacing. This procedure uses lasers to remove the top layer of skin, which reveals younger-looking skin below. The laser also stimulates the production of collagen, which can help to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.</p>
<p class="info">Exfoliants are also an important part of any anti-ageing skincare routine. Exfoliants help to remove dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, leaving behind brighter, smoother skin. There are many different types of exfoliants available, including chemical peels, masks, and scrubs.</p>
<p class="info">Antioxidants are also important, as they help to fight the free radicals that can damage collagen and lead to premature ageing. Look for products that contain vitamin C or niacinamide.</p>
<p class="info">Finally, it is important to keep your skin hydrated by using moisturizers or hydrating serums. Hydrated skin looks healthier and younger than dry skin. Hyaluronic acid is a molecule that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent moisturizer. Glycerin is another good moisturizer that helps to attract water to the skin.</p>

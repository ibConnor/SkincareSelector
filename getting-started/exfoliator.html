<h3 class="sub-title">Exfoliator</h3>
<p class="info">Exfoliation is the process of removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin. The exfoliation process can be achieved by physical, chemical, or mechanical means. In cosmetic use, exfoliants are commonly used to improve skin texture, remove keratin buildup, reduce pore size and prevent clogged pores.</p>
<p class="info">Mechanical exfoliation involves using a tool to brush or scrape away dead skin cells. This method is most effective on dry skin, and it can irritate sensitive skin types. Shaving is an example of mechnical exfoliation.</p>
<p class="info">Chemical exfoliation involves using substances that dissolve the glue-like proteins that bind together layers of dead skin cells. Chemical exfoliation can be done at home with over-the-counter products like glycolic acid and salicylic acid, or it can be done in a spa setting with stronger peels such as TCA (trichloroacetic acid) or phenol peels.</p>
<p class="info">Physical exfoliation uses a tool to physically remove dead skin cells from the surface of your face. Gentle physical exfoliators include brushes and sponges made from natural materials such as goat hair; scrubbing brushes; loofahs; and microdermabrasion tools. These tools work best for dry, normal or oily skin types, but they can be too harsh for sensitive skin types.</p>

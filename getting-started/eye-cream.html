<h3 class="sub-title">Eye cream</h3>
<p class="info">Eye creams are one of the most luxurious products in any skincare routine. They can be used to treat a variety of different concerns and should ideally be applied before your regular moisturiser to lock in hydration. They can also be used on their own, especially if you want to focus on one particular area such as the eyes or lips.</p>
<p class="info">Eye cream are also known as eye gels or eye serums, depending on the formulation. The most common ingredients found in eye creams include antioxidants like vitamin c and E, peptides and hyaluronic acid. Eye creams often contain retinol or caffeine to help reduce dark circles and puffiness under the eye area.</p>
<p class="info">You should always use specific eye cream that target specific concerns, otherwise you can just use a moisturiser for general purposes.</p>

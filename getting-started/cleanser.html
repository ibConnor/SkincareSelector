<h3 class="sub-title">Cleanser</h3>
<h4>Cleansers are designed to remove excess oil, dirt and debris from the skin.</h4>
<p class="info">Cleansers are the first step in your skincare routine, and they're meant to remove excess oil, dirt and debris from your skin. But while they do remove all of those things (which is why you should use one), they're not meant to remove makeup.</p>
<h4>When looking for a cleanser, keep in mind that all cleansers are not created equal.</h4>
<p class="info">Now that you know what a cleanser is, it's time to talk about how to find the one that's right for you. The first thing to consider when buying a cleanser is how it's going to be used. Are you looking for something that will take off your makeup? Or maybe something more gentle? Do you have sensitive skin? Is there an ingredient in this product that could potentially irritate your skin?</p>
<p class="info">Once you've figured out what kind of cleanser will work best for your needs, it's time to think about texture and consistency. For example: Some people prefer gel-like products while others like creamier ones; some like exfoliating scrubs while others don't; some need anti-aging products while others just want something basic. Once againâ€”it all depends on what works best for YOU!</p>
